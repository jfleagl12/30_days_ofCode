Interfaces are an important concept in Java and in a few other languages like C#.

Here you are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature 
int divisorSum(int n). (The divisorSum function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors.) 
Your only task is to write a class Calculator which implements the interface.

Note : The class Calculator shouldn't be public.

Good luck!

Input Format

Only one line containing integer n

Constraints 
1≤n≤1000

Output Format

In the first line print "I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic" without quotes. In the next line print the sum of divisors of 
n as given in problem statement.

Sample Input

6
Sample Output

I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12
Explanation

Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6. 1+2+3+6=12.
