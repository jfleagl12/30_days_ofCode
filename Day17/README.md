Create a class Calculator which consists of a single method power(int,int). This method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters and finds np. If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n and p should be non-negative".

Code for handling Input/Output is already provided in the editor. Please read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it.

Note: The class Calculator mustn't be public.

No need to worry about constraints, there won't be any overflow if your code is correct.

Input Format

First line contains T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contain two integers n and p separated by a space.

Output Format

Output T lines. For each test case if n and p are positive then print np else print "n and p should be non-negative" without quotes.

Sample Input

4
3 5
2 4
-1 -2
-1 3
Sample Output

243
16
n and p should be non-negative
n and p should be non-negative
Explanation

T=4 
In the first test case both integers are positive hence the output is 35=243 
In the second test case both integers are positive hence the output is 24=16 
In the third test case both the integers are negative hence the output is "n and p should be non-negative" 
In the fourth test case n is negative hence the output is "n and p should be non-negative"
